# Feedparser

I came up with an idea that would allow me and my colleagues to perform our tasks more efficiently. Checking messages is very time consuming, it is our daily duty.
In the first phase of the project, I connected to the .rss pages. I am currently working on expanding the website database.
In the near future, I want to add an option to filter by keywords that I am interested in during the work.
